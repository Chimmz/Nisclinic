               Plastic surgeries performed on men with larger-than-normal breasts are called gynecomastia. After breast enlargement in men, breast reduction surgery in men is Gynecomastia.
               Having large breasts in men is a condition encountered regardless of any disease or hormonal disorder. This can sometimes lead to psychological problems.

               Breast enlargement in men can be understood from the clothes of the people. It prevents them from entering the sea in the summer months. This situation makes people unhappy and affects their daily lives.

               It is performed by plastic surgeons in operating room conditions to correct the problem of breast enlargement in men.

               There are several methods of gynecomastia surgery. Whichever method is applied, the breast is reduced. People can return to their social lives in a very short time.

            While providing a more natural and athletic appearance in the body, regional excess fat is completely removed.

            With this method, sound waves only target fat cells and, unlike other methods, do not damage some important tissues (such as connective tissue, vessels and nerves). There are no bruises, edema, irregularities and scars seen in classical liposuction. You can permanently get rid of regional fat accumulated in the back, abdomen, hips, waist circumference and arms.</p>

If a person has lost large amounts of weight while being overweight, this is extremely beneficial for one's health. However, the skin, which was previously stretched with fullness, becomes loose and sagging, making the person uncomfortable. The abdomen, breast, hips, arms and thighs are the areas most affected by weight loss.

               <b>Surgical Operation: </b>
               If the excess on the arm is just excess skin, it is the removal of excess skin, and if there is excess adipose tissue, it is the removal of both excess skin and adipose tissue. The only annoying aspect of arm lift surgeries is the straight line scar that will remain in the back of the arm. Unfortunately, it is not possible for arm lift surgeries to be scarless. This scar can be partially hidden in the arm. This scar is visible when you raise the arms. Therefore, the candidate for arm lift surgery should think carefully about whether the scar on the arm or the excess will bother him more and decide accordingly.
               <b>Operation Process</b>
               The arm augmentation operation is performed in a hospital environment and under general anesthesia. As is the case when preparing for all surgeries requiring general anesthesia, it is necessary to fast for six hours and not to use aspirin and derivatives for 10 days, as they will increase bleeding, before arm lift surgery. The operation time is 2-3 hours. You may need to stay in the hospital overnight. You may have drains to prevent leaks that may occur after the surgery, they will be removed in a few days. After the operation, your arms will be wrapped with a lightly pressed bandage to minimize any edema and bleeding that may occur. This bandage is removed within three days. For the next three weeks, an elastic bandage is used in the form of a sock that covers the arm. You will not have stitches to be removed.
               
               Your pain usually does not happen, but if it does, it can be controlled with painkiller tablets. You can return to your daily life within three to four days after the operation, but you should avoid movements that will put weight on your arms, especially in the first days, and avoid activities that require effort for about two months.
               
               The scar inside your arm will be puffy red at first, but will thin and fade over time, and will become less obvious as time passes.</p>

               The fact that women do not find their genitals aesthetic, not enjoying sexual intercourse and dogmatic thoughts about sexuality psychologically prevent the sexual life of the person and communication between couples. In women experiencing aesthetic anxiety. Feelings such as misunderstanding and shyness may predominate. These factors also cause adverse effects on sexual life. In addition, deformation, deformity and changes in skin color that cause these feelings can negatively affect sexual life. These changes that the vagina undergoes physically can be eliminated by applying to genital aesthetics.

            <h6 class="heading-6 u-mgb-xsm"> In which cases is genital aesthetics applied? </h6>
            <p class="parag u-mgb-xlg">
               Genital aesthetics is applied as a result of the fact that the vagina loses its structural elasticity due to the fact that women have given birth many times. Congenital physical abnormalities in the structure of the vagina are restored with genital aesthetics. In case of structural deformations in the vulva, especially if the outer lips are large, aesthetic operation is applied. Vaginal aesthetics can be applied in order to eliminate sexual intercourse disorders due to the deformation of the vagina or the incision made in the vagina in difficult births. Sagging of the urinary bladder and rectum can cause sexual dysfunction and incontinence problems. For this reason, uterine prolapse may occur as a result of the interaction of the pelvic system.

            <p class="parag u-mgb-xlg">
               Labiaplasty surgery is an aesthetic operation performed to remove sagging on the inner or outer lips. While the bad image of the physical structure of the vagina creates psychological anxiety in most women, it causes sexual dysfunction. For this reason, aesthetic intervention can be applied to reduce the inner lips.
               The inner lips, which have a curved structure in the outer genital area, have a different appearance in every woman. However, if the inner lips are larger than normal and a puffy appearance occurs, an aesthetically negative picture emerges. In addition, the color of the inner lip tissue may change in some periods and for various reasons. This physical condition causes the person to be psychologically damaged and to experience some sexual function problems. Large inner lips also increase the risk of infection. Large outer lips can cause difficulties in choosing clothes. Labiaplasty provides the repair of such problems.
            </p>
            <h6 class="heading-6 u-mgb-xsm">Who is suitable for labiaplasty operations?</h6>
            <p class="parag u-mgb-xlg">
               Inner and outer lip reduction operations can be applied to people who have given birth or who have never given birth. In addition, it is not an operation that can prevent normal birth in later years. Labiaplasty surgeries can also be performed on virgins. The operation performed is 3-4 cm away from the hymen area. Therefore, it does not create any position that will threaten the hymen.

               With the adolescence period of the person, genital aesthetics is applied with the aim of eliminating the structural deformations that have become a psychological problem until this time. These operations are performed under local anesthesia in a very short period of 20-30 minutes.

               There may be loosening in the vagina as a result of women having a large number of normal births or the structural loss of elasticity of the vagina due to congenital factors. This can cause sexual dissatisfaction for both men and women. In addition, due to the loss of sensitivity, women's not enjoying sexual intercourse may cause problems with orgasm. For this purpose, vaginal tightening operations are performed within the framework of genital aesthetic surgeries to ensure the structural tightness of the vagina.</p>

               The weakness of the elastic structure, which is expressed as relaxation and enlargement in the vagina, causes men and women to not enjoy sexual intercourse. Vaginal tightening operations eliminate this problem and provide couples with the opportunity to live their sexual life in a healthier and higher quality way.

In addition, faulty stitches in the vagina area due to excessive incisions cause pain during sexual intercourse. In vaginoplasty operations, both aesthetic and functional structure can be corrected by removing the deformation in the vagina structure.
